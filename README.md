# policeK9

Lite PoliceK9 script for FiveM Please check out other scripts by me on CFX (https://forum.cfx.re/u/angelicxs/activity/topics) or my paid stuff on Tebex (https://angelicxs.tebex.io/)

For ESX or QBCore.

This is a lite Police K9 Script that provides enough functionality to get a solid K9 unit rolling.
Main functionality:
* Enter/Exit Vehicles
* Search/Attack Players
* Stay
* Follow
* Job & Rank Lock
* Third-Eye Spawn/Despawn


** QBCORE ONLY **
* Search player owned vehicles

Buttons for commands can easily be swapped in the config.
