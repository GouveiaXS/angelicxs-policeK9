This is a lite Police K9 Script that provides enough functionality to get a solid K9 unit rolling.
Main functionality:
* Enter/Exit Vehicles
* Search/Attack Players
* Stay
* Follow
* Job & Rank Lock
* Third-Eye Spawn/Despawn
* Search player owned vehicles

Buttons for commands can easily be swapped in the config.
